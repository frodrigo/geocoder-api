Using Docker Compose to deploy Mapotempo Geocoder environment
=============================================================

Building images
---------------

The following commands will get the source code and build the geocoder-api
and needed images:

    git clone https://github.com/mapotempo/geocoder-api
    cd geocoder-api/docker
    docker-compose build

Publishing images
-----------------

To pull them from another host, we need to push the built images to
hub.docker.com:

    docker login
    docker-compose push

Running on a docker host
------------------------

First, we need to retrieve the source code and the prebuilt images:

    git clone https://github.com/mapotempo/geocoder-api
    cd geocoder-api/docker
    docker-compose pull

Then use the configuration file and edit it to match your needs:

    # Copy production configuration file
    cp ../config/environments/production.rb ./

    # Customize production.rb with your settings
    # On line 31 change `france.kml` to `poly/france.kml` (or anything else.)

    # Get france.kml and put it in `poly` directory.

Finally run the services:

    docker-compose up -d

Initialization
--------------

After the first deployment, you need to initialize Addok database.

First, download and put json files in `data` directory. You may may to prefix them with numbers to ensure the order of the import.

Then run the initialization script:

    ./initialize.sh
